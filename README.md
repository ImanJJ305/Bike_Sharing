## Overview of Project

### Purpose and Background
The purpose of this project is to create visualizations for the ride sharing data of a popular bike share company for the monthe of August (in New York) to determine if it is a good idea to persue a similar service in another state (Des Moines). 

### Results
- The total number of rides for August is 2,344,224.
    
- 81% of riders in the month of August were Subscribers. Thus indicating that they were returning users.

- Younger individuals born in the late 90's have longer trip durations than their older counter parts.

- Male subscribers use the ride sharing service more frequently than any other subscriber type.

### Summary

- There is still much analysis that needs to be done in order to determine if this business will also work in Des Moines. Things to consider would be the population type and size. I would recommend taking a look at other bike sharing data for other nearby areas as well to see if this is successfull in those areas as well.
